# Mirage Chat React Native
## Mirage Chat React Native is a repository containing an one-to-one chat application built using React Native. This application was built by me as a way to learn React Native, and is far from perfect but still functional. The developer is currently working on a better version of the application.
This isn't a stable chat app.

## Features
The Mirage Chat React Native application includes the following features:

* One-to-one chat functionality
* User authentication
* Firebase backend

## Installation
To install and run the Mirage Chat React Native application, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install the required dependencies using npm install.
* Create a Firebase project and add the configuration to the application.
* Start the application using npm start or expo start.

* Usage: Once the application is installed and running, you can use it to send and receive messages with other users who are also using the application. The user authentication functionality ensures that only registered users can use the application.

# Contribution
This repository is not intended for other developers to learn from, as it was built solely as a learning project. However, if you would like to contribute to the project, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
